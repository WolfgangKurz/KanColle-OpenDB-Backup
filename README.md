## ðŸ“‚ Restore database
### 1. Combine
Combining splitted data is very easy, not difficult.

Just use ```cat``` command with wildcard, it will return the combined contents.

### 2. Unzip (Decompressing)
All backup file was compressed with pbzip2, so ```bzip2``` or ```pbzip2``` is required to unzip backup file.

Using ```pbzip2``` is "highly" recommended.

### 3. Example
```bash
$ cat opendb-backup.sql.bz2.* | bzip2 -d > opendb-backup.sql
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Incremental backup
Backup files was dumped as incremental, using mysqldump and mysqlbinlog.

If you want to restore database, you need to restore all backups, and execute all restored queries.


## ðŸ“¦ Utility
You can also use Backup and Restore utilities, written in PHP.

Use those utilities in terminal like below:
``` bash
$ php db-backup.php --help
$ php db-restore.php --help
```

Backup utility requires ```db-backup-cfg.php``` file and you can modify ```db-backup-cfg-template.php``` to get config file.
